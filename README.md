Use Cas 1:  OCI Free Tier - Tenancy in US West San Jose with 1 Availability Domain 

This version of the tensor flow demo is the foundation of the a local HA capability using Fault Domains

This is the entry point of an incremental multi-tenancies, multi-cloud, and multi-region cloud applications provisioning scenario that is automated using the following tools: GitHub, Terraform, Ansible, OCI-CLI and Oracle Linux bash shell. 

Behind the scene we used our own custom tool (Click 2 Consume), build in Oracle CloudShell as well as ORM (Oracle Managed Resources - Terraform Managed Service).  

Jenkins pipelines will be used to glue together Infrastrcutre as Code (IaC), DevOps, CI/CD and Cloud Native principles.
